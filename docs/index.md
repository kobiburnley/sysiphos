Sysiphos
========

`Sysiphos` is a graph-based task scheduler.

# Why?

After looking at projects like 
[Airflow](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org),
[Chronos](https://mesos.github.io/chronos)
or [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/)
there seems to be a place for a solution that is 

* providing a rich language agnostic scheduler DSL
* independent of a (technical) domain or focus area like Hadoop
* not reinventing the wheel
* usable with minimal dependencies
* JVM-based
* developed with an _API first_ UI approach

Sysiphos wants to be that solution.
