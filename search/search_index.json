Its currently not a feature-rich as any of those solutions and provides basic scheduling.\nSee the Introduction to read about the core concepts.","title":"Why?"},{"location":"/intro.html","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/intro.html#introduction","text":"In Sysiphos workflows are defined with by a JSON object:\n{\n  \"id\" : \"new-flow\",\n  \"tasks\" : [{\n    \"id\" : \"new-task\",\n    \"type\" : \"shell\",\n    \"command\" : \"curl https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random?category=${category!\\\"dev\\\"}\",\n    \"children\" : [\n      {\n        \"id\" : \"new-task\",\n        \"type\" : \"shell\",\n        \"command\" : \"echo I am child task, I get triggered when my parent is done. \"\n      }\n    ]\n  }]\n}\nIn our context we also call this the Flow Definition. A Flow Definition has a unique ID and a list of root tasks, that describes the work to be done. Every task can have a list of child tasks that get executed after the parent task has successfully finished its work.\nThis task structure lead to a tree (a Directed Acyclic Graph, short DAG) of tasks that should be executed.\nA flow definition can have one or more schedules assigned to it, that will trigger the execution repeatedly.\nWhen Sysiphos decides to execute a flow definition (because of the schedule or because it was triggered by the API) it will create a Flow Instance with a reference to the ID of a definition.\nA flow instance has have a Context which is a dictionary of values that can be seen as additional attributes that define the instance. This context is available for string interpolation in tasks that provide some kind of template.\nNext it will also create Flow Task Instance for the first root task and try to execute it. Task will per default be retried 3 times if a failure happens.\nAll of these entities allow a granular tracking and control of the execution. To handle the execution of multiple flow instances in parallel Sysiphos uses Actors.\nSee Execuction Model for a more detailed overview of the interaction of the actors with the introduces entities.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"/execution-model.html","text":"","title":"Execution Model"},{"location":"/execution-model.html#execution-model","text":"The execution model of Sysiphos is implemented by an actor system using Akka.\nEvery entity from the Introduction has a corresponding actor which updates the underlying repository for that entity:\nThere is a singleton actor to control the time based aspects of the scheduling which also acts as supervisor for the Flow Instance actors.\nThese instance actors will spawn Flow Task Instance actors matching the parent-child relation of the tasks in the definition.\nIf a instance should be executed and the number of instances to consider for execution depend on the parallelism options in the flow definition:\nThe task instance actors are responsible for executing the task and logging the results, which differs depending on the task type (see Tasks):\nDepending on the result of the execution, the state of the task instance and the corresponding flow instance will be updated.

Same meaning that they execute the same flow definition with the same context values. This could occur when the instance execution is slow, so that the schedule (but also calls to the API) leads to more of the same instances.
